# Django BigQuery Application

A Django application to display data from the following BigQuery public datasets:

- `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.stories`
  - URL: [localhost:8080/latest_hacker_news](localhost:8080/latest_hacker_news)
  - Return: Displays the title, author's name, and date of publication of the latest 5 articles from the `stories` table.

- `bigquery-public-data.github_repos.sample_commits`
  - URL: [localhost:8080/most_commits](localhost:8080/most_commits)
  - Return: Displays the individuals with the most commits from the `sample_commits` table in 2016. Display the name and number of commits sorted from most to least commits.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have a working environemnt installed

- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#pip)
- [Virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-virtualenv) for python

    > [venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#venv) (for Python 3) and [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#virtualenv) (for Python 2) allow you to manage separate package installations for different projects. They essentially allow you to create a “virtual” isolated Python installation and install packages into that virtual installation. When you switch projects, you can simply create a new virtual environment and not have to worry about breaking the packages installed in the other environments. It is always recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python applications.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/ethan-lamwah/earls-assignment.git
    ```

2. Change directory to `earls-assignment` folder

    ```zsh
    cd earls-assignment/
    ```

3. Create a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-virtualenv) by running `venv`.

    For `Unix/MacOS`

    ```zsh
    python3 -m venv my-venv
    ```

    For `Windows`

    ```shell
    py -m venv env
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment just created

    For `Unix/MacOS`

    ```zsh
    source my-venv/bin/activate
    ```

    For `Windows`

    ```shell
    .\my-venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

   *If you want to leave the virtual environment, simply run `deactivate`.*

5. Change directory to `bigquery_sample` project

    ```zsh
    cd bigquery_sampleD/
    ```

6. Install all packages using requirements files

    The `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies of `django 2.2` and `google-cloud-bigquery 3.4.0`

    ```zsh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. [Configure ADC setup](#configure-adc-setup-in-django-settingspy) to your own credentials

8. Run django server at `8080` port

    For `Unix/MacOS`

    ```zsh
    python manage.py runserver 8080
    ```

    For `Windows`

    ```shell
    py manage.py runserver 8080
    ```

## Set up authentication to use Google API and client libraries

[Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) is used to authenticate Google API and client libraries. For information about setting up ADC, see [Provide credentials for Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).

### Configure ADC setup in django `settings.py`

The default ADC is set to use `./credentials/application_default_credentials.json` as User credentials.

***(You have to provide your own credentials at the location since the defualt credential is revoked. Otherwise, you need to configue the django settings.py as below).***

If you wish to [provide your own credentials set-up](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) like [service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#attached-sa), simply set `USE_GCLOUD_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS` in django `settings.py` to `False`.

```py
USE_GCLOUD_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS = False
```
